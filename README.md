Development
-----------

The coffeescript files are the development versions. The \*.js files are
created with [coffeebar][], which you can install with:

``` sh
$ npm install -g coffeebar
```

With coffeebar installed, you can use the following to have coffeebar watch,
compile, and minify the coffeescript files:

``` sh
$ coffeebar -w -m src
```
